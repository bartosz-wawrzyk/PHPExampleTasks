As part of data processing, the implementation of the "make" method of the Pipeline class should be completed.
The "make" method should take a variable number of functions and return a new function that takes a
one parameter $arg.
The returned function should call the first function in "make" with the $arg parameter and call the second
function with the result of the first function.
The returned function should continue calling each function in "make" in order,
following the same pattern and return the value from the last function.
For example, calling make(function($var) { return $var * 3; }, function($var) { return $var + 1; },
function($var) { return $var / 2; }), and then calling the returned function with the argument 3
should return 5.
